# WebScrapping

## Ambitionbox_WebScrapping.ipynb

This script involves web scraping using Selenium WebDriver, a tool that enables automated interaction with web pages. Here's what happens step by step:

Accessing the Website: Selenium WebDriver is utilized to open the AmbitionBox website and navigate through it.

Tag Retrieval: Specific HTML tags on the web pages are identified and accessed to extract relevant information. This could include details like company names, ratings, reviews, or other data available on the site.

Data Extraction: Using the identified tags, all required information is systematically gathered and stored.

Creating a DataFrame: The extracted data is structured into a tabular format using a DataFrame (typically with pandas in Python). This ensures the data is easy to manipulate and analyze.

Saving Data: The DataFrame is saved as a CSV file named Ambition_box_Top_Companies_Data.csv, making it ready for further analysis.

## Ambitionbox_data_cleaning_and_analysis.ipynb

This script focuses on cleaning and analyzing the data extracted earlier. The steps likely include:

Data Cleaning:

Removing duplicates or irrelevant data.

Handling missing values, such as filling them with placeholders or removing incomplete records.

Standardizing formats (e.g., converting text to lowercase or ensuring consistent date formats).

Data Transformation: Making the data more analysis-friendly by adding derived columns, sorting, or reshaping it.

Data Analysis: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights from the data. This could involve:

Calculating statistical measures (e.g., average ratings, top-rated companies).

Visualizing patterns and trends using plots and graphs.

Final Insights: The cleaned data and analyzed results can then be used for decision-making, further reporting, or visual representation.

Essentially, the first script focuses on gathering raw data from the web, while the second script refines and makes sense of that data.
